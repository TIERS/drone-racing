# TIERS Drone Racing 

Gazebo simulator with Hector quadrotor to train for the TIERS drone racing challenge. 

The races are later done with a Tello drone controlled via ROS, as part of the master course *Perception and Navigation in Robotics*.

## Get Started

This instructions are for Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic already installed.

Clone this repo into your workspace (the code below creates a new catkin workspace named `drone_racing_ws` in your home folder):

```
mkdir -p  ~/drone_racing_ws/src && cd ~/drone_racing_ws/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TIERS/drone_racing.git
```

Install dependencies

```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-geographic-msgs ros-melodic-hector-gazebo-plugins ros-melodic-hector-sensors-*
```

We also need some Gazebo models that we use for the virtual race scenario. You have two opcions here, download the full Gazebo models database, or just a few that we provide to be able to run this simulations. Either way, first create a folder where Gazebo can find your models:

```
mkdir -p ~/.gazebo/models
```

### Option 1: Full Gazebo Database

Download Gazebo models database (we actually only use a few of them, this will download the full database with approx. 400MB of basic models):

```
git clone https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models/ ~/.gazebo/models
```

Read more about the Gazebo database [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=model_structure&cat=build_robot).

### Option 2: Minimal amount of models

Copy to the same folder the models included in this repo (change the path if you cloned the repo somewhere else):

```
cp -r ~/drone_racing_ws/src/drone_racing/gazebo_models/* ~/.gazebo/models/
```


## Build the workspace

We recommend using `catkin build`. Install it if needed with

```
sudo apt install python-catkin-tools
```

and then run

```
cd ~/drone_racing_ws
catkin init
catkin build
```

Build the uav messages with
```
catkin build hector_uav_msgs
```

## Run the simulator

Run the simulator with

```
source ~/drone_racing_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch tiers_drone_racing hector_dronerace.launch
```

Start the motors in another terminal window/tab:
```
source ~/drone_racing_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosservice call /enable_motors "enable: true"
```

In order to control the UAV with keyboard teleop, install it with
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-teleop-twist-keyboard
``` 

if you don't have it yet, and run the teleop node in a separate terminal window/tab:
```
rosrun tiers_drone_racing tello_controller.py 
```

## Camera view

Install the `image_view` package:
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-image-view
```

```
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw
```
